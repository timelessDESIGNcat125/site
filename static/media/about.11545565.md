# About This Site

Modern websites are _too_ clean, corporate, and almost sterile in their design.
I wanted to do something a little unique and make a site that goes against the
grain and back to the roots of the internet, with an old 90's style website. It
turns out that nailing that old look isn't quite as easy as I thought, and a
hastily thrown together set of ideas doesn't automatically evoke that nostalgic
feeling.

## The Logo

The flashing logo on the home page of the site is a screenshot of WordArt from
Microsoft Word downscaled via a dithering algorithm. Dithering used to be
common on the internet, used to compress images (via an extremely limited color
palette) to save network bandwidth. The aggressive compression of the image
leaves behind visual artifacts in the form of dot patterns, especially in the
grayscale image where shading can only be achieved by varying dot density. I
personally love the grainy effect dithering adds to the image; it's like a form
of digital age (similar to modern JPEG compression artifacts from resharing an
image many times).

The logo itself was designed to be obnoxious and prominent on the page, as well
as to showcase many of the different text effects in WordArt. The logo features
shadows, reflections, bevels, and outlines, and is by modern standards an
absolute eyesore. If anything, it looks too good for the era I'm targeting, but
if I downscaled the image any further some parts would become illegible. I
settled on this size (after spending way too much time pondering this
relatively insignificant piece of the site) to keep as many distinct effects in
the image as possible.

The word "`timeless`" is written in lowercase and in the plainest font of the
image for the style to match the word itself. If I had more time I would go
back and change it to a Serif font and remove the shadow entirely to make it
look straight out of a book. In contrast, the word "`design`" is written in
small capitals, rotated, beveled, reflected, and in color. The cheap 3D look
plus the grain from artifacting makes it look dated, especially in grayscale,
antithetical to the style and meaning of the previous word. Not to mention the
offensive and incongruous color choices.

## Background

Nothing screams "modern" more than a plain solid or gradient color background.
So I found a pattern that reminds me of paper cups and fast-food dining room
furniture of the era and wrapped the entire site in it. Just google
"`90's pattern`" if that doesn't ring a bell. In the process of making this
site I've already lost my cursor to the sea of confetti a few times.

I put important and relevant text content on the site on top of white
backgrounds for readability, but for an even more authentic recreation of old
website styles, I would have forgone the white boxes entirely. The flashing
borders around the logo and the links in the corner help to draw attention to
their presence, and have a very distinct "old" look about them.

## Hit Counter

A staple of any sufficiently old website is a tiny image counting the number
of total or unique visitors. I blew it up here for emphasis. Refresh the page
a few times and try it out!

## Internals

Alas, while the site may (hopefully) look old on the outside, it's actually
developed using very contemporary tools. Please do not attempt to view this
website, especially not the game, on older devices and browsers, i.e. IE.
I have also fixed the sizes of many visual elements intentionally for
thematic accuracy, so try to view this site on a desktop device if possible,
which is likely already the case if you're reading this now.
