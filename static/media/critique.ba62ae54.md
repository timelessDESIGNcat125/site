# Cookie Clicker

[The hit web game](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) from the peak of the idle game era is nearing its 10 year anniversary. It's a satire of sorts, mocking (simultaneously, ironically, feeding) the insatiable greed of players and society at large for intangible, incomprehensible, and purely virtual numbers.

The game has a lot of staying power; its recent re-release has [topped the charts](https://www.gaming.net/cookie-clicker-continues-to-dominate-the-steam-charts/) of the most popular game distribution platform Steam. Yet its premise and its gameplay are so simple and plain, so uncomplicated that it plays itself. No human interaction required. [Researchers have dubbed this](https://pixl.nmsu.edu/files/2018/02/2018-chi-idle.pdf) the "zero-player game".

## What is it?

The idea is dead simple: you click on a cookie, you get a cookie (not real, of course). You convert clicks into worthless points, and your valuable time into regret. Who could find pleasure in that?

Once you click a few times, you'll be given an opportunity to increase your production rate autonomously, so you can continue being a productive member of society and leave the silly game aside. Unless, of course, you want more (you do).

Many have covered this phenomenon ad nauseum, so I will give links for further reading on the psychology of the game and why some of us get hooked on it: [Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/cookie-clicker-gets-inside-your-psychological-kitchen/), [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7bypk/cookie-clicker-wasnt-meant-to-be-fun-why-is-it-so-popular-8-years-later), [DailyDot](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/cookie-clicker-julien-thiennot-incremental-games/). I strongly suggest you don't open the game if you don't have days of free time to spare, you've been warned.

## You're kidding.

No, I wish I was kidding. The very concept is a timesink incarnate. To prove it, I boiled it down to its core and made a stripped down version you can play [here](/#/game) (again, you've been warned).
